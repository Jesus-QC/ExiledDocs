# Exiled Introduction

## About EXILED

**EXILED** is a low level plugin framework for SCP: Secret Laboratory.

It offers an event system for developers to hook in order to manipulate or change game code, or implement their own functions.

All **EXILED** events are coded with [Harmony](https://harmony.pardeike.net/) using IL transpilers, meaning they require no direct editing of server Assemblies to function, which allows for two unique benefits.

- The entirety of the frameworks code can be freely published and shared. Allowing developers to better understand how it works, as well as contributing to the framework itself.
- Since all of the code related to the framework is done outside of the server assembly, things like small game updates will have little, if any, effect on the framework.
